Note:
We watched the tutorial, which is about live currency converter, and followed the basic structure of it but we changed a lot of codes such as, we renamed the currency names, and we made the conversion so that it can convert from any currency to any currency.
We wrote the length, weight, and temperature conversion codes by ourselves based on what we learned through tutorial and swift function explanations online.
The currency converter works perfectly fine in a single-view app but when we moved to the tab-view app it is not working anymore. We tried to troubleshoot and debug for 3 days but it still doesn't work so we decided to separate it into two apps.
We suspect this is because of the URL unwrapping but we do not know how to solve it.

Instructions to run the files
1. Open RealAwesomeConverter.xcodeproj / AwesomeConverter.xcodeproj in macbook with xcode software installed in it
2. Press the play button and allows the simulator to run.
Note for running AwesomeConverter.xcodeproj:
When the simulator opens, click the left side and right side of picker view once each to activate the choices of currencies
3. Put the amount you would like to convert in the text box on the top.
4. Choose "To" and "From" units you would like to convert.
5. Press "convert" and the result will be at the bottom of the screen.
